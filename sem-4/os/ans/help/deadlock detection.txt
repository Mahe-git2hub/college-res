1.	Let Work and Finish be vectors of length m and n respectively. Initialize Work= Available. For i=0, 1, …., n-1, if Allocationi = 0, then Finish[i] = true; otherwise, Finish[i]= false.
2.	Find an index i such that both
a) Finish[i] == false
b) Requesti <= Work
If no such i exists go to step 4.
3.	Work= Work+ Allocationi
Finish[i]= true
Go to Step 2.
4.	If Finish[i]== false for some i, 0<=i<n, then the system is in a deadlocked state. Moreover, if Finish[i]==false the process Pi is deadlocked.
